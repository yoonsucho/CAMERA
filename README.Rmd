<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CAMERA is to estimate causal effects using summary statistics in multiple ancestries. CAMERA provides:

1) Selecting genetic instruments for multiple populations. 
1) Estimating the causal effect where exposure and outcome summary statistics are from different ancestral populations.
1) Jointly modelling causal and pleiotropic effects across multiple populations. 

## Installation
You can install the released / development version of CAMERA from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
